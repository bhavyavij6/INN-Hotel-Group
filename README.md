# üè® Booking Cancellation Prediction for INN Hotels Group

## üß© Problem Statement

A substantial number of hotel bookings at INN Hotels Group are canceled or result in no-shows, primarily due to flexible cancellation policies and changing customer preferences. These disruptions lead to significant operational and revenue losses. The objective is to develop a data-driven solution capable of identifying potential cancellations in advance.

## üìä Business Context

**Client:** INN Hotels Group, Portugal  
**Challenge:** High volume of booking cancellations leading to revenue leakage, suboptimal inventory utilization, and operational inefficiencies.  
**Solution Objective:** Leverage historical booking data to build a classification model capable of predicting cancellation likelihood.  

**Strategic Impact:**
- Improved pricing and promotional strategies  
- More accurate forecasting and room allocation  
- Reduced dependency on costly last-minute recovery efforts

## üß† Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key drivers of cancellations.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Process variables such as `lead_time`, `market_segment_type`, and past cancellation history.
3. **Modeling:** Train a **Logistic Regression** model using 70% of the data.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. **Business Recommendations:** Translate model insights into actionable strategies.
